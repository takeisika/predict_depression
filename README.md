Judith Johnson. “Case study clinical example CBT: First session with a client with symptoms of depression (CBT model)” https://youtu.be/7LD8iC4NqXM. Oct 23, 2014

<h2> Approach </h2>
<p> 1- A subject who gets assessed for depression answers regular questions </p>
<p> 2- Analyze the obtained audio data of their reaction with this system </p>
<p> 3- By keeping track of the results, detect symptoms of depression earlier </p>

<h2> Methodology </h2>
<p> ・A depressed individual tends to use some specific vocabularies such as absolutist words, negative words and first person words. </p>
<p> => Calculate what percentage those words are spoken in the audio data (by using the LIWC dictionary)</p>
<p> ・A depressed individual tends to speak slower </p>
<p> => Calculate WPM (words per minutes) in the audio data </p>
<p> ・A depressed individual tends to speak monotonously </p>
<p> => Caluculate voice tone by examining frequency dispersion of between 80~250Hz (human vocal range) in the audio data</p>
