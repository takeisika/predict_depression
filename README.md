<h1>Function</h1>
<p>Symptomatic tendencies of depression</p>
<p>・The use of specific words</p>
<h3>---> Calculate the percentage of absolutist, negative, and first person words spoken</h3>
<p>・Slow speech</p>
<h3>---> Measure words per minute (WPM)</h3>
<p>・Monotonous speech</p>
<h3>---> Examine frequency dispersion between 80~250Hz (human vocal range)</h3>




<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p> I aimed to tackle the worsening issue of depression by building a system based on the following methodology:</p>
<p> (1) Conducting routine questions to individuals being assessed for depression</p>
<p> (2) Analyzing the obtained audio data using my originally developed program that calculates the percentage of absolutist, negative, and first person words spoken (using the LIWC dictionary), measures words per minute (WPM), and examines frequency dispersion between 80~250Hz (human vocal range) to detect symptomatic tendencies of depression such as slow and monotonous speech and the use of specific words </p>
<p> (3) Tracking the results to facilitate earlier detection and treatment of depression.</p>
<p> This approach addresses the primary obstacles of delayed identification and care of the condition and the lack of quantitative diagnostic methods. </p>
